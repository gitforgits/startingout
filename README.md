# Starting out : An open source sci-fi story

## What?

So what's this? Well; it's an open source story. Or it will be, if you want! 

The goal of this repository is to teach beginners a proper Git workflow. Unfortunately most schools still barely touch on the subject and even many professional devs don't know how to do this. Learning how to work on your own branch, merging in changes from other branches and submitting Pull Requests to get your changes merged into the main branch is a must for any developer. 

## Who are you?

We are Georg Metzger ([/u/desrtfx](https://www.reddit.com/user/desrtfx)) and Niels Dommerholt ([/u/nutrecht](https://www.reddit.com/user/nutrecht/)) from the [/r/javahelp](https://www.reddit.com/r/javahelp/) and [/r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/) subreddits. Together we have over 30 years of experience as developers, Georg as an Automation/Control Systems engineer/programmer and Niels as a java backend dev. 

## How can I join?

In general open source projects you can join should have a ‘[CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)’ file in the repository that describes how you can help. This one is no exception so [check it out](CONTRIBUTING.md)!

## FAQ

### Do I need to understand Git?

A: Yes. There is a link below for a great tutorial. Check that out first. The workflow we are going to teach you however doesn't use too many complex git commands. The most complex part are the merges which sound scary at first but are in fact someting you will get comfortable with in a short while. 

So the goal isn't so much to teach you the git basics as it is to actually put them in practice in a way that teaches you how to use git in a professional setting.

However: if you screw up we'll explain what happened so don't worry about this. On of the beautiful things about version control is that it's almost impossible to lose work.

### Can I use a Git GUI like SourceTree?

A: You can but I would advice against it. The biggest benefit of learning Git on the command line is that it will be available pretty much anywhere. It doesn't matter at what company you start to work or what server you log into; the commandline 'git' will pretty much always be available.
